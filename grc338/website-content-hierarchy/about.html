While our popularity continues to soar, we strive to maintain a balance between demand and supply. Rest assured, we usually have ample quantities available well into the early evening each day. From the beloved classics like Char Siu, Siopao, and Philly Cheesesteak to the exciting creations of Garlic Chicken, Breakfast, Thai Basil Beef, Kimchi Carnitas, Blue Swimmer Crab, Tika Masala, Berbere, and Kung Pow, our menu caters to diverse palates and culinary preferences. We value your input and welcome suggestions for new and exciting bao combinations.
